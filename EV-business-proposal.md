# Refocusing Electric Vehicle Marketing Strategies

## Design:

### Backstory:

The Department of Energy has revealed new research funding opportunities focusing on topics related to electric vehicle (EV) charging.<sup>[1](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/)</sup>

- $4 million to promote strong partnerships and programs that increase workplace charging (regionally or nationally) to make PEV ownership more realilistic for consumers in underserved communities, such as demographics that are unable/ minimally able to charge vehicles at home.

- $10 million for the research, development, and demonstration of novel technologies that mitigate the costs of DC Fast charging equipment for EVs that lay the groundwork for increased EV adoption.

- $20 million to expedite the adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and its corresponding supporting infrastructure through community-based public-private partnerships. These partnerships need to demonstrate PEV technologies and infrastructure through innovative applications, share their results (data, key take-aways, and best practices) with a broader audience. Projects that stimulate clean energy jobs and/or impart novel transportation solutions to under-served communities are of particular interest.



### Client:
Ford Motor Company (otherwise known as Ford) is refining their electric vehicle strategy. Their current plan being implemented is to make the transition to EVs smooth and seamless. Thus, they are electrifying three of their most iconic vehicles:
* Mustang Mach-E (electrified Mustang)
* E-Transit (electrified Transit, the USA's best-selling van).
* F-150 Lighting (Ford F-150, USA's top-selling truck)

The key demographic targeted by Ford is the commerical van and pickup industries. Currently, they are under-emphasized in the EV industry. Ford plans to provide these customers with more accessible pricing, enhanced productivity, and decreased ownership costs.

Ford has a variety of home charging solutions. In addition, they possess North America's largest public charging network, 63,000+ charging plugs.<sup>1</sup>
