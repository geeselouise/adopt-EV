# Refocusing Electric Vehicle Marketing Strategies

## Design:

### Backstory:

The Department of Energy has revealed new research funding opportunities focusing on topics related to electric vehicle (EV) charging.<sup>[1](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/)</sup>

- $4 million to promote strong partnerships and programs that increase workplace charging (regionally or nationally) to make PEV ownership more realilistic for consumers in underserved communities, such as demographics that are unable/ minimally able to charge vehicles at home.

- $10 million for the research, development, and demonstration of novel technologies that mitigate the costs of DC Fast charging equipment for EVs that lay the groundwork for increased EV adoption.

- $20 million to expedite the adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and its corresponding supporting infrastructure through community-based public-private partnerships. These partnerships need to demonstrate PEV technologies and infrastructure through innovative applications, share their results (data, key take-aways, and best practices) with a broader audience. Projects that stimulate clean energy jobs and/or impart novel transportation solutions to under-served communities are of particular interest.



### Client:
Ford Motor Company (otherwise known as Ford) is refining their electric vehicle strategy.<sup>[2](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/05/19/the-ford-electric-vehicle-strategy--what-you-need-to-know.html)</sup> Their current plan being implemented is to make the transition to EVs smooth and seamless. Thus, they are electrifying three of their most iconic vehicles:
* Mustang Mach-E (electrified Mustang)
* E-Transit (electrified Transit, the USA's best-selling van).
* F-150 Lighting (Ford F-150, USA's top-selling truck)

The key demographic targeted by Ford is the commerical van and pickup industries. Currently, they are under-emphasized in the EV industry. Ford plans to provide these customers with more accessible pricing, enhanced productivity, and decreased ownership costs.

Ford is well-equiped to handle the EV transition for their consumers. They own North America's largest public charging network, 63,000+ charging plugs. The EVs have Cloud connected navigation, which directs EV owners to the nearest charging stations and gives recommendations on places to charge on trips. Additionally, Ford customers can utilize a FordPass which provides easy access and payment for charging stations.

## Purpose/ Problem:

To leverage and expand Ford's EV resources to better assist under-served communities and regions in-need of improved EV infrastructure, with a specific focus on van and pickup truck users.
