# Refocusing Electric Vehicle Marketing Strategies

## Design:

### Backstory:

The Department of Energy (DOE) has revealed new research funding opportunities focusing on topics related to electric vehicle (EV) charging.<sup>[1](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/22/fact-sheet-biden-administration-advances-electric-vehicle-charging-infrastructure/)</sup>

- $4 million to promote strong partnerships and programs that increase workplace charging (regionally or nationally) to make PEV ownership more realilistic for consumers in underserved communities, such as demographics that are unable/ minimally able to charge vehicles at home.

- $10 million for the research, development, and demonstration of novel technologies that mitigate the costs of DC Fast charging equipment for EVs that lay the groundwork for increased EV adoption.

- $20 million to expedite the adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and its corresponding supporting infrastructure through community-based public-private partnerships. These partnerships need to demonstrate PEV technologies and infrastructure through innovative applications, share their results (data, key take-aways, and best practices) with a broader audience. Projects that stimulate clean energy jobs and/or impart novel transportation solutions to under-served communities are of particular interest.

You are pitching an innovative and novel data sciecne project focusing on enhancing EV infrastructure in under-served communities funded by one of these afforementioned DOE grants to Ford Motor Company.

### Client:
Ford Motor Company (otherwise known as Ford) is refining their electric vehicle strategy.<sup>[2](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/05/19/the-ford-electric-vehicle-strategy--what-you-need-to-know.html)</sup> Their current plan being implemented is to make the transition to EVs smooth and seamless. Thus, they are electrifying three of their most iconic vehicles:
* Mustang Mach-E (electrified Mustang)
* E-Transit (electrified Transit, the USA's best-selling van).
* F-150 Lighting (Ford F-150, USA's top-selling truck)

The key demographic targeted by Ford is the commerical van and pickup industries. Currently, they are under-emphasized in the EV industry. Ford plans to provide these customers with more accessible pricing, enhanced productivity, and decreased ownership costs.

Ford is well-equiped to handle the EV transition for their consumers. They own North America's largest public charging network, 63,000+ charging plugs. Plus, they have over 2,300 EV-certified dealers across the United States and 644 EV-certified comercial vehicle centers. The EVs have Cloud connected navigation, which directs EV owners to the nearest charging stations and gives recommendations on places to charge on trips. Additionally, Ford customers can utilize a FordPass which provides easy access and payment for charging stations.

## Purpose/ Problem:

Improve EV infrastructure by targeting more under-served communities to facilitate the sale and upkeep of EVs, with a specific focus on van and pickup truck customers. 

#### Data Science Solution Path:
   - Exploratory data analysis
        - current and planned EV stations to show under-served communities.
        - commercial van and pickup truck customer locations
        - EV needs of van and pickup truck customers
        
#### Impact Hypothesis:
Investing more money, time, and resources into building EV infrastructure will facillitate more EV sales by tearing down purchasing barriers and create new avenues of revenue for the company. 

#### Measures of Success:
- Increase number of EV charging stations in under-served communities.
- Increase EV sales in under-served communities.

#### Risks and Assumptions:
- EV sales will accelerate again in a post-pandemic world.
- Oil prices will increase again.
- Consumers will still have a need and desire to 
- Ford pickup truck and van owners are primarily located in less densely populated areas.
- Money, time, and resources invested in EV infrastructure will
