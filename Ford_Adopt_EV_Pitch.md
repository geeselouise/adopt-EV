# Investing in Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure

## Purpose/Problem:
Ford would like to improve EV infrastructure in under-served communities to facilitate the sale and upkeep of EVs, with a specific focus on van and pickup truck customers. As Ford moves towards fulfilling this goal, they're seeking advice regarding: 
1) Which communities are currently under-served and within the scope of the desired customer base.
2) Which communities they should prioritize as they roll out this new infrastructure.

### Data Science Solution Path:
- Exploratory data analysis
    - showcasing how rural communities are under-served
    - current and planned electric vehicle charging stations
    - commercial van and pickup trucks
        - customer-base locations
        - EV needs specific to those vehicles
- Machine Learning Model
    - Clustering Algorithm for identification of areas that truck and commercial van customers would benefit most from improved EV infrastructure
        - Guassian Mixture Models
    - Regression Algorithm to determine which of identified areas will yield a higher profit for Ford.
        - Random Forest regression
    
### Impact Hypothesis:
Investing more money, time, and resources into building EV infrastructure will facillitate more EV sales by tearing down purchasing barriers and create new avenues of revenue for the company. The major impacts are:
1) Building more charging stations to support the sale of EVS.
2) Supporting rural communities.
